// enforces SAML SSO and the browser session is authenticated but not
// SSO-authorized for that org, GitHub serves this interstitial with HTTP 200 —
// so the uploadToken is absent even though the user has write access.
//
// The SSO authorization is server-side state (it lasts ~24h and is granted only
// by completing the identity-provider handshake in a browser), so it is NOT a
// cookie that can be copied; the fix is to re-authorize at /orgs/<owner>/sso.
//
// We require signals SPECIFIC to the interstitial and scoped to THIS owner. We
// deliberately do NOT match the words "SAML"/"single sign-on" anywhere on the
// page: those appear in GitHub's site chrome/help links on virtually every page
// (and in any repo that is simply about SAML), which would be a false positive.
